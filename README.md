# Overview
The Kaggle to AWS Workflow Automation project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the data pipeline process, from downloading datasets from Kaggle to visualizing insights in Tableau. This project leverages GitHub Actions, AWS services, and Python scripts to automate the entire workflow, ensuring efficient data processing, storage, and visualization with minimal manual intervention.

# Description
This project automates the extraction of datasets from Kaggle, uploads them to Amazon S3, processes them using AWS Glue, and ultimately stores the refined data in an Amazon RDS instance. The data is then made available for advanced analysis and visualization in Tableau. The entire pipeline is orchestrated using GitHub Actions, ensuring seamless integration and deployment of each step.

The pipeline begins with the automated download of datasets from Kaggle, which are then uploaded to an S3 bucket for storage. AWS Glue Crawler is triggered to catalog the data, making it ready for analysis. The processed data is transferred to an RDS instance, enabling structured storage and further SQL-based manipulation. Finally, the data is connected to Tableau, where users can create dynamic visualizations to derive actionable insights.

# Key Components
# Data Sources
Kaggle Datasets: Downloaded and stored in an S3 bucket for further processing.
# Technologies Used
AWS S3: Centralized storage for both raw and processed datasets.
AWS Glue: Crawls and catalogs data, making it accessible for analysis.
Amazon RDS: Relational database service used to store structured data.
Python & Boto3: Facilitates interactions with AWS services and processes data.
Tableau: Visualizes the processed data, providing insights through interactive dashboards.
AWS CloudFormation: Automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure.
GitHub Actions: Manages the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process.
# Workflow
Data Ingestion: Automatically downloads datasets from Kaggle and uploads them to S3.
Data Processing: AWS Glue Crawler processes and catalogs the data, making it ready for further analysis.
Data Storage: The processed data is transferred to an Amazon RDS instance.
Visualization: Tableau connects to the RDS instance, enabling the creation of real-time visualizations.
Automation and Deployment: GitHub Actions orchestrates the entire pipeline, ensuring that each step from data ingestion to visualization is automated.
# Deployment Steps
Set Up AWS Services

Configure S3 for data storage, Glue for data cataloging, and RDS for structured data storage.
Set up IAM roles with appropriate permissions for accessing S3, Glue, and RDS.
Configure GitHub Actions

Define workflows in GitHub Actions to automate the pipeline, from downloading datasets to uploading them to S3.
Integrate AWS CloudFormation templates to automate infrastructure provisioning.
Develop and Test Python Scripts

Write Python scripts to handle dataset downloads, S3 uploads, and data transfers to RDS.
Test these scripts locally to ensure they function correctly before integration into the CI/CD pipeline.
Set Up Tableau for Visualization

Configure Tableau to connect to the Amazon RDS instance using the appropriate connectors.
Develop dashboards that provide insights based on the processed data.
Automate Deployment and Monitoring

Deploy the full pipeline using GitHub Actions, automating each stage of the process.
Implement monitoring and logging to track the pipelineâ€™s performance and ensure data accuracy.
# Conclusion
The Kaggle to AWS Workflow Automation project offers a robust, automated framework for managing data pipelines from Kaggle to Tableau. By leveraging the power of AWS services and GitHub Actions, this project ensures efficient data processing, storage, and visualization, providing a scalable and reliable solution for data-driven insights.
